## Results

In this project, we explored food image classification using the **Food-101** dataset, which contains 101,000 images across 101 food categories. We implemented and compared three machine learning models:

- **Support Vector Machines (SVMs):**  
  SVMs struggled with the dataset's complexity, achieving low accuracy (~5.6%). While RBF kernels and regularization helped slightly, SVMs are not ideal for high-dimensional, variable image data.

- **Traditional Neural Networks:**  
  Flattened image inputs (~250,000 features) led to poor performance (~6% accuracy). The model underfit the data and lacked the complexity to learn spatial patterns and textures.

- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):**  
  CNNs achieved the best results, with validation accuracy around **26%**. Their ability to capture shapes and patterns makes them well-suited for this task. With deeper architectures and longer training, CNNs have strong potential for further improvement.

CNNs offer a promising foundation for food image classification. With further training and expansion to more categories, this approach can support applications in:

- üçΩÔ∏è Dietary tracking  
- ü§ñ AI cooking assistants  
- üìç Restaurant recommendation systems


## Test Images

The project includes test images for various food categories including:
- Burgers, Cheesecake, Chicken Wings
- Cr√®me Br√ªl√©e, Dumplings, and more
- Representative samples from the food-101 dataset

## Future Work

- Implement transfer learning with pre-trained models
- Explore additional data augmentation techniques
- Experiment with ensemble methods
- Deploy model for real-time food classification
